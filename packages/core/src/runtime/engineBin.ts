// One source of truth for "where is the claude/codex binary", and for the PATH we hand
// their child processes.
//
// Every surface that is NOT a terminal hits the same wall: a GUI-launched process (VS
// Code opened from the Dock, the desktop app, launchd, cron) inherits the bare launchd
// PATH — /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin — not the user's shell PATH. An engine installed
// by nvm / fnm / mise / asdf / volta / bun / pnpm / homebrew therefore reads as missing
// while the user is literally running it in another window.
//
// Getting this wrong is worse than a bad status line. @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
// falls back to ITS OWN bundled native CLI whenever pathToClaudeCodeExecutable is
// undefined, and the packaged VS Code extension ships no node_modules (vsce runs with
// --no-dependencies), so that fallback can never resolve. The user gets "Native CLI
// binary for darwin-arm64 not found. Reinstall @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk…", which
// blames the SDK for a PATH problem. Always passing an explicit absolute path is what
// keeps the shipped extension working; the bare-name fallback below exists only so a
// genuinely-missing engine fails as a plain ENOENT, which the install notice explains.
//
// Sync on purpose: this feeds default parameters and the SDK options object, and every
// step is a filesystem stat or one cheap `which`. Successful lookups are cached.
